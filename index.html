        <p>
            I'm a recent graduate from DePaul University with a degree in Economics. I started off my undergrad career at University of Colorado.
            After going to school there for two years I decided I wanted to make the career move of becoming a fireman. I left Colorado and came home
            to take an EMT class at my local community college. While doing my clinicals, I realized that I don't really like to touch people I don't 
            know. This resulted in me going back to school and getting my degree from DePaul.
        </p>

        <p>
            After graduating I began looking for a job. While on the job hunt, it became clear to me that I wasn't getting any attention from jobs that 
            interested me. As a result, I decided to take a chance on something I've always been interested in and join the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. 
            Upon completion of the bootcamp, I hope to find a job as a developer or software engineer.
